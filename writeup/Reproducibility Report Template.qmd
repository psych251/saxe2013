## Introduction

### Justification for choice of study

My research interests are best described by two questions: 

1. What is it that artificial neural networks actually learn from data, and how do they do so? 
2. What other neural processes do we need to understand in order to account for human-like reasoning and problem solving in noisy, few-shot settings?

The first question is directly inspired by the work of Saxe et al., and I hope that the methods and intuitions that underlie their work will help me pursue a research program that examines the learning dynamics and knowledge representations of contemporary deep learning systems such as large language models.

The second question requires an intimate familiarity with neural network theory. In reproducing Saxe et al., I also hope to fortify my ability to understand and build upon the mathematics that underlies deep learning.

Thus, reproducing this study will both expand my methodological toolkit and provide me with the confidence to pursue a flavor of research that I currently still find a little intimidating.

### Anticipated challenges

For me, this project is inherently challenging because I lack a rigorous background in mathematics. No code is available online, so I will have to complete the implementation based on just the paper. I am also cautious about the feasibility of condensing its intuitions into a 5 minute presentation that is accessible to other students who might also lack existing background. However, it is precisely these challenges that motivate me to take on this project, and I see no significant technical challenges that might inhibit its success.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study.

### Differences from original study

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

### Measure of success

Please describe the outcome measure for the success or failure of your reproduction and how this outcome will be computed.

### Pipeline progress

Earlier in this report, you described the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. Please describe your progress on each of these steps (e.g., data preprocessing, model fitting, model evaluation).

## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.

```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Key analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them). None of these need to be long.
